OpenSCAD files for the York hack space logo

These are made using the logo at https://github.com/tomwardill/york-hack-space

You should be able to export them to STL then print as they are for about 50
pence coin size.

I still want to improve them with the following.

The petals could do with a nicer shape.
It would be better to print them all as sperate parts with Green leaves, white
petals and a Yellow H. Then glue them together.

They are licenced under the GPL v3 as defined in the LICENCE file. Feel free to
share or use under those terms. For more info see http://www.gnu.org/
